I am a post-doc researcher at the University of Salzburg ([Department of Economics](https://www.plus.ac.at/economics)) on the project "[High-dimensional statistical learning](https://zk35.org)" funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), and obtained my PhD in economics at the Vienna University of Economics and Business on high-dimensional time series analysis in 2019. Moreover, I am/was a scientific consultant for the European Commission (Joint Research Center), the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA).

My research interests include macroeconomics and econometric methods for dynamic models. In particular, I am interested in monetary economics, business cycles and predictive inference. The focus of my work is on econometrics, machine learning techniques and Bayesian data analysis. My work has been published in the _Journal of Econometrics_, the _International Economic Review_, the _Journal of Applied Econometrics_, the _Scandinavian Journal of Economics_ and the _Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization_, among others.
