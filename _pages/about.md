## Welcome to my website
I am an Assistant Professor at WU Vienna University of Economics and Business ([Department of Economics](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/economics/)) working in macroeconomics and (macro)econometrics. Previously I was employed at the Universities of Vienna and Salzburg, and I contribute as an expert to the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in Ispra.

My research interests more specifically include empirical macroeconomics and econometric methods for dynamic models. I am especially interested in monetary economics, business cycles and forecasting. The focus of my work is on time series analysis, Bayesian econometrics and machine learning techniques.

My work has been published in the _Journal of Econometrics_, _Journal of Business & Economic Statistics_, _Journal of Applied Econometrics_ and _International Economic Review_, among others.
