I am an Assistant Professor at Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna, Department of Economics). My research interests include macroeconomics and econometric methods for dynamic models. In particular, I am interested in monetary economics, business cycles and predictive inference. The focus of my work is on econometrics, machine learning techniques and Bayesian data analysis. My work has been published in the _Journal of Econometrics_, _International Economic Review_, _Journal of Applied Econometrics_ and _The Annals of Applied Statistics_, among others.
