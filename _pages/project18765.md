Inference with Bayesian nonparametric models in the presence of measurement errors and outliers
======

This page is dedicated to a collection of materials in the context of project 18765, funded by the [Jubiläumsfonds](https://www.oenb.at/en/About-Us/Research-Promotion/The-OeNB-Anniversary-Fund.html) of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank with EUR 168,000.00 for the period from 12/2022 to 11/2024.

**Abstract**. Data is often imperfect and incomplete when it is first released. A related problem are outlying observations such as those during the recent Covid-19 pandemic, which may severely affect parameter estimates in conventional linear models. On a related note, there may be changes in transmission channels of fiscal or monetary policies, which linear models are not equipped to detect. Particularly for structural and predictive inference, measurement errors and outliers may severely bias parameter estimates and thus yield misleading and suboptimal policy implications. 

This project aims to develop new Bayesian nonparametric methods that are robust to nonlinear relationships in the data, measurement errors and outliers. In addition, the proposed framework is capable of handling highly nonstandard data that is potentially irregular and sampled at different frequencies than key economic series of interest. The proposed research extends state-of-the-art econometric methods for high-dimensional nonlinear time series analysis (used for both scenario analysis and predictions). A key contribution is a flexible model for measurement errors that captures the full history of vintages for a set of crucial economic indicators.

* "Forecasts with Bayesian vector autoregressions under real time conditions," forthcoming _Journal of Forecasting_. [[DOI](https://doi.org/10.1002/for.3055)/[WP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04984)] **Abstract**. This paper investigates the sensitivity of forecast performance metrics to taking a real time versus pseudo out-of-sample perspective. I use monthly vintages of two popular datasets for the United States and the euro area. Variants of vector autoregressions, varying the size of the information sets and the conditional mean and variance specification, are considered. The results suggest differences in the relative ordering of model performance for point and density forecasts depending on the forecast simulation design used to evaluate predictive accuracy. Differentials are more pronounced for the European dataset, and stochastic volatility is a particularly attractive model feature to obtain accurate forecasts in real time.
